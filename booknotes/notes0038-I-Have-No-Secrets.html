<p>儿童悬疑读物，其中的温情部分多于悬疑部分。</p>

<h3 id="2">2</h3>
<p>She's nine and has only been here a year. We're all fostered – I've been here since I was two and so has Finn, who's nearly six. I've heard Mum say Olivia was 'hard to place'. Maybe that goes for Finn and me too, though Olivia's problems are different from ours. Finn is autistic, and right now is lining all his beans up neatly on the plate with his fingers. He's obsessed with straight lines. Olivia's a whirlwind – sometimes a tornado – and she's loud. Finn and I don't speak, so life is very different and much noisier since she came</p>
<p>I've been this way all my life. I can see, though, and I can hear, and sometimes people forget that; they don't realise that I have a functioning brain. Sometimes people talk about me as if I'm not even there. I hate that.</p>
<h3 id="17">17</h3>
<p>He even tells a bad joke about a chicken, but it isn't funny enough to make me laugh. I can only laugh spontaneously, I can't make it happen.</p>
<p>He soon realises what I already know.</p>
<p>I have no control.</p>
<h3 id="36">36</h3>
<p>'I froze up, Jemma, and everything I wanted to say went out of my head. I felt so stupid standing there unable to speak. I don't know where the tears came from, but once I started I couldn't stop and I felt even worse so I had to just get out of there.</p>
<p>'I want you to know that I do want to try again. You are my sister and I want to know you and for you to know me.</p>
<p>'Please, please forgive me and let's start over – please!</p>
<h3 id="55">55</h3>
<p>I am here at a Glowlight concert with my sister.</p>
<p>She is glowing.</p>
<p>I am alight!</p>
<h3 id="authors-note">AUTHOR'S NOTE</h3>
<p>The device that Jemma uses in the book is inspired by a real invention, developed by researchers at the Weizmann Institute. Trials have shown that some severely disabled people and people with locked-in syndrome, for whom other systems have not worked, have been able to use this device. And as a relatively inexpensive product it has the potential to make AAC technology accessible for more people than ever before. It has not yet gone into production, but my hope is that by raising awareness, this book may help to persuade a company to take this up and make it commercially available. I dream that one day everyone who has the potential to communicate will have access to the equipment they need.</p>
<h3 id="acknowledgements">ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</h3>
<p>From the Weizmann Institute I would like to thank Lee Sela and Noam Sobel for answering many questions about their recently developed communication device.</p>
